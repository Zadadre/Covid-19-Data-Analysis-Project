# Covid 19 Data Analysis Project ðŸ¦ ðŸ“Š

## About
The Covid 19 Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing Covid-19 datasets from India using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Two main datasets were utilized for this project: `Covid_19_india.csv` and `covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`. The analysis aims to provide insights into the spread of Covid-19 and the vaccination progress across states in India.

## Dataset Description
1. **Covid_19_india.csv**: This dataset contains Covid-19 statistics for different states/union territories in India, including the number of confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and other relevant information.

2. **covid_vaccine_statewise.csv**: This dataset provides information on Covid-19 vaccination progress at the state level, including the number of vaccinated and registered individuals.

## Analysis Highlights
### For Covid_19_india.csv:
- Dropped unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
- Modified datetime format for easier analysis.
- Created a new column named "active cases" by subtracting 'cured' and 'deaths' from 'confirmed'.
- Visualized the top 10 states with the most active cases and death cases in India using bar plots.
- Analyzed the trend of deaths over time by State/Union Territory using a line plot.

### For covid_vaccine_statewise.csv:
- Analyzed and visualized the top 5 states with the highest total vaccinated individuals using a bar chart.
- Identified the last 5 states with the least total vaccinated individuals.
- Explored the top 5 states with the highest total registered individuals.
